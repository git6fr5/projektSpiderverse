The free high-quality reverberator of "Ambient Reverb" is intended first of all for operation with sound material in a ambient genre, though with success it can be applied also in other musical styles and the directions (for example for a vocal very excellently).
Distinctive feature of a plug-in is the broad range of reverberation time (up to 100 seconds) that allows to receive types of reverberation, different on character, and also an opportunity in a literal sense to freeze sounds, at the same time to receive interesting sound pads, like Frippertronics. The reverberator of "Ambient Reverb" works by the principle of algorithmic reverberation with calculation enough the dense sound reflections on time, allowing to receive realistic reverberation without effect of granularity.

• 16 factory presets
• Two band parametric equalizer
• Indicator and knobs of input/output level
• Low load of the central processor
• the 32nd and 64th bit versions of a plug-in
• Windows xp and above
• VST 2.4 protocol

INSTALLATION:
1. To copy the "AmbientReverb.dll" file from the "x32" folder (for 32-bit Windows) or "x64" (for 64-bit Windows) in the folder with your VST plug-ins, for example, of "C:\Program Files\VstPlugins"
2. Depending on DAW used by you to make scanning regarding new VST plug-ins.

It is necessary to mark that circumstance that the author of this plug-in and these lines spends enormous personal time for the operations connected to development and advance of a free VST plug-in therefore modest material support of the developer from users as not only the fate of this project, but also development of musical technologies and progress in general more depends on it will be extremely reasonable!
